## Installation

This library does not require any external dependencies beyond those used in the src directory files. However, ensure you have a modern version of Node.js installed that supports ES Modules.

you can install the module with `npm i nhs-mesh-client`

jsdocs can be accessed [here](https://nhsdigital.github.io/Javascript-mesh-client/)

## Setup

This client is compatible with the sandbox, integration and production MESH systems.

The repository is structured into several directories, each containing specific types of operations:

- `get/`: Contains functions for retrieving information from the message exchange system.
- `put/`: Contains functions for updating the status of messages.
- `post/`: Contains functions for creating or sending messages.
- `examples/`: Contains examples on how to use the functions in practical scenarios.

## Functions

### Handshake

- `handShake`: Establishes a connection with the message exchange system, ensuring that communication is possible.

### Message Retrieval

- `getMessageCount`: Retrieves the count of messages currently stored in the mailbox.
- `readMessage`: Reads the content of a specific message.

### Message Management

- `markAsRead`: Marks a message as read or acknowledged, updating its status within the system.

### Message Creation and Sending

- `sendMessage`: Sends a new message to the specified recipient.
- `sendChunkedMessage`: Sends a large message in chunks, suitable for handling large datasets or files.

### Configuration and Examples

- `loadConfig`: Loads and returns configuration settings for the message exchange system, preparing it for operation.
- `createMessages`: Demonstrates how to create and send a message using the system.
- `createMessageChunks`: Demonstrates how to send a large message in chunks.
- `receiveMessage`: Demonstrates how to retrieve and process messages from the mailbox.

## Usage

To use any of the provided functions, first ensure you have the necessary configuration. This typically involves setting up authentication details, specifying the target mailbox IDs, and other relevant settings. Here's a basic example

```javascript
import { loadConfig, createMessages } from "./src/index.js";

async function main() {
  const config = await loadConfig({
    logLevel: "DEBUG",
    url: "https://example.com/messaging",
    // additional configuration options...
  });

  await createMessages(config);
}

main();
```
