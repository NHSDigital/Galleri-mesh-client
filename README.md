Welcome to the Galleri MESH client. This repository houses a Javascript MESH client which is used by the Galleri project to communicate with [MESH](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh), however it is intended to be universal so any teams that want to use javascript to talk to mesh could utilize this client

## Setup

This client is compatible with the sandbox, integration and production MESH systems. To use it follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/repository-template.git
```

2. If you are using the sandbox then turn it on and run `npm test` to check everything is working
   If you are using the integration environment then you will need to set up the following variables to override the defaults for the sandbox environment.
   You can do this by either updating your `~/.bashrc` for linux or `~/.zshrc` or you can put the values into a `.env` file in the repo, it will be excluded by .gitignore

```shell
# Required variables

# enables or disabled sandbox mode, this should be set to `true` for the sandbox or `false` for integration environments
export MESH_SANDBOX=true

# The ID of the mailbox that you want to send messages from, default is the mesh-sandbox id
export MESH_SENDER_MAILBOX_ID="X26ABC1"

# The Password of the mailbox that you want to send messages to, default is the mesh-sandbox password
export MESH_SENDER_MAILBOX_PASSWORD="password"

# The ID of the mailbox that you want to receive messages from, default is the mesh-sandbox id
export MESH_RECEIVER_MAILBOX_ID="X26ABC2"

# The Password of the mailbox that you want to receive messages to, default is the mesh-sandbox password
export MESH_RECEIVER_MAILBOX_PASSWORD="password"

# The location of the certificate used by the sending mailbox, only required for integration and production.
MESH_SENDER_CERT_LOCATION="/cert/location/here"

# The location of the key used with the certificate above, only required for integration and production.
MESH_SENDER_KEY_LOCATION="/cert/location/here"

# The location of the certificate used by the receiving mailbox, only required for integration and production.
MESH_RECEIVER_CERT_LOCATION="/cert/location/here"

# The location of the key used with the certificate above, only required for integration and production.
MESH_RECEIVER_KEY_LOCATION="/cert/location/here"

# The location of the CA cert which is required for integration and production MESH systems.
MESH_SENDER_CA_LOCATION="/cert/location/here"

# Set the log level you want to see, for testing the recommended setting is `DEBUG` but there are also `ERROR` and `INFO` levels
LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"

# The message content that will be delivered
MESH_MESSAGE="This is a test"
```

3. cd into the repository

```shell
cd galleri-mesh-client
```

4. run the integrated test by running `npm test` to verify that everything is working.

### Prerequisites

The following software packages, or their equivalents, are expected to be installed and configured:

- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container runtime or a compatible tool, e.g. [podman](https://podman.io/),
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) version manager,
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) 3.82 or later,
- [GNU coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) and [GNU binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/) may be required to build dependencies like Python, which may need to be compiled during installation. For macOS users, this has been scripted and automated by the `dotfiles` project; please see this [script](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dotfiles/blob/main/assets/20-install-base-packages.macos.sh) for details,
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) required to run Git hooks,
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

> [!NOTE]<br>
> The version of GNU make available by default on macOS is earlier than 3.82. You will need to upgrade it or certain `make` tasks will fail. On macOS, you will need [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, then to install `make`, like so:
>
> ```shell
> brew install make
> ```
>
> You will then see instructions to fix your `$PATH` variable to make the newly installed version available. If you are using [dotfiles](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dotfiles), this is all done for you.

### Configuration

Installation and configuration of the toolchain dependencies

```shell
make config
```

## Usage

See MeshService.test.js to see an implementation of the mesh module services configured to send and receive a message/file.

You will need the dotenv package for the following.
To connect to the sanbox environment the following environmental variables need to be set:

    LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
    MESH_URL="https://localhost:8700"
    MESH_SHARED_KEY="TestKey"
    MESH_SENDER_MAILBOX_ID="X26ABC1"
    MESH_SENDER_MAILBOX_ACCESS_ID=""
    MESH_RECEIVER_MAILBOX_ID="X26ABC2"
    MESH_RECEIVER_MAILBOX_ACCESS_ID=""
    MESH_DATA_FILE="./tests/testdata-organizations-100000.csv"
    MESH_SANDBOX="true"
    MESH_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT="30"

Alternatively see meshModuleTemplate.js which contains an example on connecting to your own MESH Mailbox by setting your own environmental variables.

#### MESH module services

The module contains a Loader, SenderService, ReceiverService and MeshService classes that need
to be configured.

Once dotenv is installed, set your values in your .env file including the message and/or file to transmit. The Loader class will initialise the environmental variables. User loaderInstance.state()
to debug the values.

The SenderService instance takes loaderInstance.senderConfig() as an argument and sets the
senderInstance values. You can pass in different loaderInstances to configure multiple senderInstances. A Payload object containing the message and/or file to transmit. A destination which is the receiver mailbox id.

The receiverService instance takes loaderInstance.receiverConfig() as an argument and sets the
receiverInstance values. You can pass in different loaderInstances to configure multiple receiverInstances.

The MeshServices instance takes as argument a senderInstance and a receiverInstance and creates
a sender/receiver relationship between the two instances. You can use meshInstance to call
sendMessage(), sendFile() and receiveMessage(). You can configure multiple meshInstances with
different sender/receiver instances and allow relationships between different senders and receivers.


### Testing

There are `make` tasks for you to configure to run your tests. Run `make test` to see how they work. You should be able to use the same entry points for local development as in your CI pipeline.

`npm test` will execute meshService.test.js.


## Design

### Diagrams

The [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) is a simple and intuitive way to create software architecture diagrams that are clear, consistent, scalable and most importantly collaborative. This should result in documenting all the system interfaces, external dependencies and integration points.

![Repository Template](./docs/diagrams/Repository_Template_GitHub_Generic.png)

### Modularity

Most of the projects are built with customisability and extendability in mind. At a minimum, this can be achieved by implementing service level configuration options and settings. The intention of this section is to show how this can be used. If the system processes data, you could mention here for example how the input is prepared for testing - anonymised, synthetic or live data.
